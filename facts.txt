Four dimensions of instruction sets:

* Operations provided in the instruction set.

* Number of explicit operands named per instruction.

* Location of the operands in the CPU and how 
  operand locations are specified.

* Type and size of operand

Categories of Instructions
1) data transfer
2) arithmetic
3) logical
4) control transfer
5) I/O
6) system
7) floating point
8) decimal
9) string

Data Transfer Instructions:
 LDA (load accumulator) LDA x where x is a location in memory
 STA (store accumulator) store acc to memory 
Arithmetic and Logic:
 ADD (add to accumulator) ADD x, x location of what to add
 NAND (NAND to accumulator)
 SHFT (shift AC contents 1 bit left, shifting in 0)
Control transfer:
 J (jump to x) J x jump to instruction in location x
 BNE (branch conditionally to x) BNE x branch to 
      instruction at x if AC is not 0
